Copy your input into your respective days input.txt 
and then do `go run . day part`

`day` here is day number, and `part` is either 1 or 2 representing each part. 

For day1, part1 do`go run . 1 1`
For day1, part2 do `go run . 1 2`

To add a new solution, create respective day folder with an input.txt and solution.go which has Part1 and Part2 functions, and then add them to the map of solutions in `main.go`
